# Plugins

ImHex is entirely built around the possibility to easily load plugins (most of it's features are actually implemented as a plugin!).

To install plugins, simply download the relevant `.hexplug` file and drop it in your `plugins` folder. The location of that folder can be found under `Help -> About -> ImHex Directories`.
